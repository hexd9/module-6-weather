# Weather Forecast

## Description

As a traveler I wanted to have an efficient and handy tool that allowed me to know the weather of any city for the next five days. I frequently travel and often find myself in need of detailed, city-specific weather information. I found existing solutions to be bloated with features I didn't need, so I decided to create my own.

## Usage

1. The Weather Dashboard is very straightforward and user-friendly.

2. Open the webpage. You'll see the main heading "Weather Forecast" at the top of the page. Below that, there's an input field next to the label "City:" and a "Search" button.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field. 

4. Click the "Search" button.
The webpage will then fetch the weather data for the city you entered and display the 5-day forecast below. For each day, it will show the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

5. To check the weather for another city, simply repeat steps 2-3.

6. Search History is saved under local storage.
