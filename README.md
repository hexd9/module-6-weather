# Weather Forecast

## Description

As a traveler I wanted to have an efficient and handy tool that allowed me to know the weather of any city for the next five days. I frequently travel and often find myself in need of detailed, city-specific weather information. I found existing solutions to be bloated with features I didn't need, so I decided to create my own.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation

No installation is needed for this great weather application. 

## Usage

1. The Weather Dashboard is very straightforward and user-friendly.

2. Open the webpage. You'll see the main heading "Weather Forecast" at the top of the page. Below that, there's an input field next to the label "City:" and a "Search" button.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field. 

4. Click the "Search" button.
The webpage will then fetch the weather data for the city you entered and display the 5-day forecast below. For each day, it will show the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

5. To check the weather for another city, simply repeat steps 2-3.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
